# Projects
* [SpaceSodomy2](https://github.com/StarikTenger/SpaceSodomy2) **[C++ | SFML, Box2d]**
    
    Game developed by the group of BMSTU and MIPT students. It is a 2d multiplayer space-shooter which takes all features of newton mechanics such as linear and angular inertia.
    My own contribution is setting up network architecture and wariting HUD library.
* [Voxel Engine](https://github.com/StarikTenger/VoxelRendering) **[C++, GLSL | OpenGL]**

    Voxel graphics visualizer, working over OpenGL and GLSL-shaders. Main features are octree-optimized ray-casting and parsing voxel models.
    My own contribution is writting octree stucture, vox format parcer, ray-casting on GLSL and camera implementation.

* [MimicGame](https://github.com/Robby-the-paladin/The-Mimic) **[Typescript]**

    University project made during summer practice. Consists of two parts: the game itself and a level editor for it.
    My contribution was writing AI architecture, basic mechanics and most of the code for the map editor.
    
    
* [Chipollino](https://github.com/StarikTenger/Chipollino) **[C++]**

    University project made during summer practice. Consists of two parts: the game itself and a level editor for it.
